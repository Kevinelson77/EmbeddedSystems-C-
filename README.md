Embedded Systems Projects done in C on an STM32F446RE Nucleo Board

Project 1: A voltage & distance display. A 19k potetiometer is hooked up to PA1 on the board and has the on board ADC enabled. 
Voltage reference is 3.3V & the potentiometer has an angle of rotation from 0 to 270 degrees. All values are displayed to the LCD.
